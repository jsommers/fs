# FS: a network flow record generator

FS is a network flow record generator.  It contains a discrete event
simulation core to generate the flow records, and relies on existing 
TCP throughput models to drive the simulation.

FS is made available under terms of the GPLv2.

Note: the originally released version of fs (as described in the INFOCOM '11)
research paper is on branch fs-orig.  The master branch is completely revamped
and includes the fs-sdn code as described in a forthcoming HotSDN paper (fs-sdn).


## Running fs

FS is implemented in Python and has a few external module dependencies:

To use fs, you need the following Python packages:
 * ipaddr 
 * networkx 
 * pydot 
 * pyparsing 
 * pytricia (py-radix is no longer supported)

To install all the above, see the requirements.txt file here and use pip:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

I'd recommend using virtualenv, then installing the packages inside
the venv.  See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv.

fs runs fastest using pypy (http://pypy.org) but also works well under the
standard CPython implementation.  

## Examples

There are a number of example configuration files in the `conf/` directory.  To run a couple of the example configuration files for 600 simulated seconds, you might do something like:

    $ python -OO fs.py -t 600 conf/ex1.dot
    $ python -OO fs.py -t 600 conf/testconf1.json

`fs` supports a DOT configuration file syntax as well as a (basically equivalent) JSON syntax.  For now, config file syntax is undocumented; take a look at the examples and our 2011 INFOCOM paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935055

To use the OpenFlow extensions (aka fs-sdn), you'll need to clone the POX git repository and point your PYTHONPATH to it.  `fs` currently is only tested with the betta branch of POX.  Once you've done those things, there are two example configurations in the `conf` folder that should work out-of-the-box:

    $ git clone git://github.com/noxrepo/pox.git ../pox
    $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/../pox
    $ python -OO fs.py -t 60 conf/openflow_small_cbr.dot
    $ python -OO fs.py -t 60 conf/openflow_small_harpoon.dot

The first few lines of output from fs when running one of the above example (OpenFlow) configurations should be:

    0.0000 fslib.config INFO     Reading config for graph test.
    0.0000 fslib.config INFO     Running measurements on these nodes: <a,c,b,controller>
